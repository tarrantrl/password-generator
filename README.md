# Password Generator

This page uses JavaScript to generate a random password. The user choses a password length from 8-128 characters and choses whether they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. At least one character type must be chosen. A random password is generated meeting these specifications and is displayed in the text box on the webpage.
